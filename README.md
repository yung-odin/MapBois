# MapBois Room Locator:
Java Application that produces an app that will locate a room when the 
user inputs a room number. This project utilizes .csv files in order to interpret
room number coordinates as well as a specified building and campus.
## Getting Started:
This project utilizes the javaFX library and well as the SceneBuilder application
## Intiaiting the project:
Once project is imported and ready to be used, run the project
### Testing the Room Locator:
The project comes with one building with given room coordinates (UTSA's Student Union). In order to find a room, type a room number 
that is in the SU Building in order to find the location for the room. If you would like to search for another room, click the home button
that it will effectively return you back to the home screen. When you find a room not located within the building, the app will return you 
an error that states that the room does not exist in specific building.
#### -Adding Rooms/Building:
Currently this app only holds a demo map to the Student Union, but has the ability to implement more maps as long as a .csv file of coordinates 
to the rooms are provided.
